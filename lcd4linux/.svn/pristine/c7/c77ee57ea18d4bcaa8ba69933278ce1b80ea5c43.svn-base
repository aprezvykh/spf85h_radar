	  to
	  make my previous commits active

	* [r705]
	  [lcd4linux @ 2006-09-04 16:47:39 by siretart]
	  These changes were necessary to make lcd4linux build on current
	  debian etch/unstable
	  systems. I cannot really imagine how this was supposed to work,
	  so I replaced
	  the old modified python.m4 with an uptodate version of
	  ac_python_devel.m4 from
	  autoconf_archive. both .m4 files seem to have a common anchestor,
	  but ac_python_devel.m4
	  has clearly seen a lot of more love, so let's better stay with
	  upstream
	  (autoconf archive), so we can blame them if anything breaks.
	  
	  Moreover, this actually works

	* [r704]
	  [lcd4linux @ 2006-09-04 16:41:21 by siretart]
	  removing debianisation from upstream source, as discussed with
	  Michael on private mail.
	  
	  Rationale: I try to keep an updated lcd4linux in debian/sid. If
	  you need the debinisation,
	  please use my packages as base. If you want more updated package,
	  please drop me a note,
	  and I'll arrange another upload to unstable (or experimental,
	  depending on the state
	  of the cvs).

	  README for HD44780 driver

2000-04-17  reinelt

	* [r48]
	  [lcd4linux @ 2000-04-17 05:14:27 by reinelt]
	  added README.44780

2000-04-15  reinelt

	* [r47]
	  [lcd4linux @ 2000-04-15 16:56:52 by reinelt]
	  moved delay loops to udelay.c
	  renamed -d (debugging) switch to -v (verbose)
	  new switch -d to calibrate delay loop
	  'Delay' entry for HD44780 back again
	  delay loops will not calibrate automatically, because this will
	  fail with hich CPU load

	* [r46]
	  [lcd4linux @ 2000-04-15 11:56:35 by reinelt]
	  more debug messages

	* [r45]
	  [lcd4linux @ 2000-04-15 11:13:54 by reinelt]
	  added '-d' (debugging) switch
	  added several debugging messages
	  removed config entry 'Delay' for HD44780 driver
	  delay loop for HD44780 will be calibrated automatically

	  [lcd4linux @ 2000-04-13 06:09:52 by reinelt]
	  added BogoMips() to system.c (not used by now, maybe sometimes we
	  can
	  calibrate our delay loop with this value)
	  
	  added delay loop to HD44780 driver. It seems to be quite fast
	  now. Hopefully
	  no compiler will optimize away the delay loop!
